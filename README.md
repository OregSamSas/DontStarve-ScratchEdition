# DontStarve-ScratchEdition
A Scratch project which is made up of a replica of the original game called Don't Starve by Klei Entertainment.

You can download the latest beta version of the [scratch project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/418133271/) from here on GitHub (under the most [recent release](https://github.com/OregSamSas/DontStarve-ScratchEdition/releases/tag/v2.9.6-beta), download the asset with the ending .sb3), then check, or even modify¹ it after opening it in [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org) [(Desktop)](https://desktop.turbowarp.org/) or other similar applications that can handle blocks not compatible with Scratch, for the release might won't be "purged" from such blocks.

¹ If you made changes or have any idea, feel free to share with me by creaing a pull request or an issue issue, or by commenting on the scratch project page.

If you have any further questions, feel free to ask them, the best is on my Scratch profile.

If we reach version 3.0, I'm planning to package it into an html file or create a normal executable application. (The icon design is already done.)
