# DontStarve-ScratchEdition
A Scratch project which is made up of a replica of the original game called Don't Starve by Klei Entertainment.

You can download the latest beta version of the [scratch project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/418133271/) from here (under the most [recent release](https://github.com/OregSamSas/DontStarve-ScratchEdition/releases/tag/v2.8-beta) download the asset with the ending .sb3), then check, or even modify¹ it opened in [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org) [(Desktop)](https://desktop.turbowarp.org/) (it is highly recommended, because the release might not be compatible with Scratch).

¹ If you made changes or have any idea, feel free to share with me by creaing a pull request, issue, or commenting on the scratch project page

If you have any further questions, feel free to ask them then.

If we reach version 3.0, I'm planning to package it into an html file or create a normal executable application. (The icon design is already done.)
